#Tetris Clone
Originally created as a school project with the intentions of becoming familiar with Unity's development environment, exercising clean code structure, object oriented design, and problem solving.

##Implementation
Most functions, such as movement, rotation, and line clearing have been implemented. However, tetromino rotation collision checking has issues with rotating near other objects.
